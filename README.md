## MNA KUMBUKA ZILE STORY ZA VISION 2030 AMA MLISHA SAHAU 

nko sure mlisahau anyway .

as a techie nmeona gava iki build a shitty health care website for 104 B na wakatumia jina technology system kuchanganya wakenya na hakuna msee wa tech ameenda kupinga iyo upuzi thats funny 

universities techies wanna inama mbaya. na system most za gava zna tumia supper old technology 80% ya system za gava are likely to fail they are slow etc 

this README is meant for the young . techies below age of 25 yrs juuu nyinyi wazee wengine mmetu fail n sheree tuu mnapiga sana .

No way mlishindwa kuangusha some systems za gava ka KRA i thought we were supreme kumbe n jaba : >) haha anyway .


# Project Overview  

This project is designed to be simple and user-friendly. The main goal of this code is to make it easier for people to send massive emails to governments and their representatives around the world. I started working on this project on **18th January 2025**, and while it is functional, it is far from perfect and requires further development to enhance its features and usability.  

---

## How It Works  

The project simplifies the process of saving government email addresses and sending mass emails:  
1. Users can save a contact list of government officials' email addresses.  
   - For example, you could save up to 100 emails for all government officials in a country like the Netherlands.  
2. Once the contact list is saved, users can create email templates.  
3. The project allows you to send the created email template to all saved email addresses.  

**Note:** This website does not directly send the emails. Instead, it:  
- Stores saved email addresses and email templates locally.  
- Opens your mail app and automatically fills in the data from the template and the list of email addresses.  

This approach ensures ease of use, as not everyone has the capacity to write emails and search for email addresses individually.

## Current Status  

The project is still under construction and requires further contributions to reach its full potential. If you're able to contribute, your help will be greatly appreciated!

## How to Run the Project  

### Prerequisites  

To run the project, you need a GitHub API token. This is used for automatically writing data to GitHub. The project stores email addresses and templates on GitHub for decentralization.  

### Decentralized Storage  

The goal is to implement a decentralized storage system by allowing users to fork the project. Data will be stored across all GitHub accounts that fork the project, eliminating any single point of authority.  

### Creating a GitHub API Token  

1. Go to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) and generate a token.  
2. For security reasons:  
   - **Grant the token read/write access to content.**  
   - **Select specific repositories** for the token to ensure it only accesses the repository you forked.  

### Configuration  

After creating your token, follow these steps:  
1. Rename the file `example.env` to `.env`.  
2. Fill in the following fields:  

```
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=  # Your GitHub token here
VITE_GITHUB_USERNAME=statehouseke  # Your GitHub username here
VITE_REPO_NAME=System-ya-Mbogi  # Fork the repo and add your username here
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_SALT=admin_password_salt  # Replace with your password salt
```

---

## Running the code 
```
git clone https://github.com/statehouseke/System-Ya-Mbogi.git

cd System-Ya-Mbogi

npm install # to install packages

npm run dev # for development

```
## OpSec and Staying Anonymous  

To maintain operational security and anonymity:  
1. Avoid using identifiable information when creating or sharing content.  
2. Double-check all commits made by unknown users to prevent malicious code from being introduced.  
3. Report any suspicious GitHub accounts to prevent abuse or blacklisting.  
4. Be cautious with your GitHub token. Do not share it or expose it in public repositories.  
5. Use secure communication channels when discussing sensitive matters.  

---

By following these guidelines, we can ensure the safety and security of the project while allowing for decentralized collaboration.

## Other Projects  

I am working on introducing more projects to address key issues like **accountability**, **governance**, and **fundraising** in a decentralized manner.  

For now, I can share a concept we’re exploring:  

We’re developing a **decentralized platform** for raising funds for campaigns, political parties, and governance initiatives. The focus is on creating a system that:  
- Removes centralized authority.  
- Ensures complete transparency and accountability.  
- Uses blockchain technology, specifically **Ethereum smart contracts**, to securely manage funds.  

The idea is to allow contributions as small as **$1**—because even with minimal individual amounts, collective efforts can achieve significant outcomes. For example, if 100,000 people contribute $1 each, that’s $100,000 raised for the cause!  

Additionally, we’re planning to use tools like **Gitcoin** to support developers working on the project. This ensures fair compensation and encourages open-source collaboration.  

This platform would empower communities to raise funds for political and governance projects while maintaining **trust**, **security**, and **fairness**.  

The journey has just begun, and I’m excited to see where this idea takes us. Contributions and feedback will be invaluable as we move forward!  

Stay tuned Contributions are highly encouraged! Let's work together to make this email system project a success other projects for later.

## last comment is 

The government has alot of funding they move carefully . we the young people dont really have much ndio maana mnaona they are paying some of the young people to interfere with the movement and the agenda. my idea is tunataka we find a way of creating a chamaa na hiii chamaa there is no center of authority anyone that joins the chama has an equal share example nii kama chama ikona watu wawili pekee they both own 50% 50% kama chama ikona  watu 1000 people, na chama shares zake ni 100% hiii itakuja ikue kila msee ana own 0.1% of the chamma n hii yote itakua loaded kwa blockchain it sound weird for now but all ideas zta come through now what does this chamma doo. soo hii chama itakua na 47 choosen leaders all from each county wote wanaeza toka nairobi na all chama leaders should be female there is a reason for these chama hukua owned na wanawake XD :>), now kaza ya hawa chama leaders ni ku represent each county remember we are not tribal but tukona counties . now main agenda yaa hii chamaa ni kwa hii chama kutakua na strict laws 

## Some of the laws include.

The county leader should not be politicians whether current or past politicians they should not come from a political family we have more than 50m humans in kenya so this law naona n suitable

The leaders will be voted after every one year.

Age limit for these leaders will be from 18 - 30 yrs.

Any member of the chamma can vote for the leader and the votes will be done through blockchain kuna alot of opensource tools kwa github.

Now every end of the Month there will be a physical meeting and evry chamma member can paricipate in the meeting.

New politicians are free to join the chamaa but old politicians are banned from joining the chamma these rules will be in the agreement and if breached the chamma will sue the person and request for damage compensation of upto 1m kes XD : ( > . 

During the meeting no leader is allowed to speak.

cant list all of them here etc.

## Role of the chamma

So role ya chamma itakua, the chamma is a national chamma na main reason chamma was formed ni we first kill tribalism.

In this chamma there will be political personel the new politicians si hawa wazee na all of them from new parties now since the kenyan law doesnt allow groups or organisations from forming a political party the people owning chamaa will be well veted and choosen  through the blockchain now we need 7 political parties why seven is because we dont want a center of authority . now the owner of the polical party can and should never try to vi for any political seat .

the polical parties 7 will have 47 representative each from every county .

now we have 47 counties the political parties will have its own counties an example is tunaeza shikanisha nairobi central naivasha alafu one party itakua ina represent hizi parts so during election our party representing the 6 counties we gave it election ikianza wanafaa kutoka from that party will find a good way to explain this .

now main aganeda ya hii chamma n funds we have some people like me who are willing to contribute so rule kadha niii hiii chamma we formed itakua responsible of supporting izo political parties interms of izo parties hazifai kua na gari if they have a car they intend of using kwa campaigns ni lazma they register the car under the chamma kumbuka we all own the chamma na we all own the parties so mtu akitaka ku invest something on the parties its better using the chamma . 

funds will mostly be collected through crypto  main being stable coins nme ona some law gava is trying to impose on crypto cause they know they cant control crypto.

now the parties tulisema creator of the parties cant vi for any seat we will have 7 parties funds collected will be destributed equally na hii itakua easy lets say nairobi want to host an event kama campaign a party will request for funds on the blockchain and state reasons the people who registered as comming from nairobi  will approve funding by voting bado kwa blockchain 

## Security Of the funds na how can we verify the votes on blockchain

Now for security of funds we will create a smart contract that strictly progibits owner of the contract from withdrawing cash and only releasing crypto to authorised personel na person na strictly checks all voters

how to identify real voters now voters ama chamma members will be required to register na biometrices information taken the info will be hashed and save on the blockchain

Hii system will mostly priotize person age 18-30 

there is alot hizi n snippets za ideas im working on na pia trying to get some funds if i make hizii n lazma ill push
